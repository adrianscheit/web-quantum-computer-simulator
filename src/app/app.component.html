    <h1>Online quantum computer simulator in your browser!</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Online quantum computer simulator implementation, free for use for everyone.</li>
        <li>Initially all qubits are |0></li>
        <li>The computer scale-up automatically as you add new operations</li>
        <li>
            For simulation time issue, try to keep the quantity of qubits low (more then 16 qubits requires some
            noticeable amount of time to simulate, and every qubit more makes the simulation about twice that slow).
            For time optimalization it is good to delete empty qubits before starting a simulation.
        </li>
        <li>Your program is not send to the server - it is running in your web-browser</li>
        <li>Simple UI - hopefully clear and good UX</li>
        <li>This application is mobile friendly (regarding the UI and simple simulations, because regarding the CPU
            usage during a bigger simulation it is far away to be mobile-friendly, because it will drain your battery)
        </li>

                KUDO to this article, that helped a lot to implement this tool. It is also very helpful in case if
                someone does not understand quantum computing:

        <app-sample-code code="{{selfLink}}#{{programJson}}#http://localhost:8080/?results=">
            To run the calculations automatically, for example by a programs generator, you can use the API.
            Simply open the browser with a program in JSON, as a parameter in the link:
        </app-sample-code>
    </p>
    Parameters are hash character ("#") separated and they are like:
    <ul>
        <li>Program in JSON - list of operations/applied gates (required)</li>
        <li>
            Callback address to be called with the results at the end, encoded as JSON with URI encoding around.
            Remember that your local server would allow the origin, otherwise there would be a CORS violation exception.
            (optional)
        </li>
